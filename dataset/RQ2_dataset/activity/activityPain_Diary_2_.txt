We want to test "Pain Diary" app. 
The current page is "activities.UserDetailsActivity".
This app allows you to make daily diary entries recording your condition and the intensity, location, nature and time of the pain you feel, as well as the medication you take and additional notes.
The main view of this app is a calendar. You can add a new diary entry by selecting a day in this calendar. You will then be asked to answer questions regarding your condition and the pain you are experiencing.
